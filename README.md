# Filmmash - Installation Guide

This document provides instructions for manually installing the **Filmmash** app on Android devices using the APK file.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the app, make sure your device meets the following requirements:

- An Android device (version 5.0 or higher).
- Enable installation from "Unknown Sources" on your device.

## Enabling Installation from "Unknown Sources"

Since the **Filmmash** app is being installed directly from an APK and not from the Google Play Store, you'll need to enable the installation of apps from unknown sources. Follow these steps:

1. **Go to your device settings:**
   - Open the **Settings** app on your Android device.

2. **Find the Security option:**
   - Go to **Security** or **Privacy**, depending on your device.

3. **Allow unknown sources:**
   - Look for **Unknown sources** or **Install unknown apps** and enable this option for the browser or file manager you’ll use to install the APK.

> **Note:** On Android 8.0 and higher, you will need to grant specific permissions to the app that’s installing the APK, such as Chrome or your file manager.
